# Fyle_Project
GitHub Repositories using by html , css , js 

I fulfill all of your requirements; as you said, I can only use HTML, CSS, JS,Â  and Bootstrap, and I add a loader as well. I didn't work on designing because I had my focus on functionality. I encountered some difficulties with the Github API, but I tried my best to fulfill your requirement of 100 APIs.


I watched many tutorials, but I designed this website with my thoughts in mind. On this website, I used JS more than HTML and CSS. The data is not hardcore; this is from the server site.
